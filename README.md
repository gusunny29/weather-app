# Welcome to my weather application

This project was definietly one I was excited to attempt and complete.
I used JavaScript with React through the entire project and used MaterialUI to style my components.
I used chart.js to style my weather charts for the day input from the user

The Public APIs I used were Visual Crossing API to access the weather data needed for each location and I also used
OpenCage API to access the city/state/country data from the location input from the text input

Nice parts of the application:

- Material UI and Chart.js allowed for ease of comfort with styling my input components and provided a seamless and smooth UI experience
- With the day requested by the user and the following week, you can see some conditions that correlate with that given day such as wind speed, humidity and precipitation percentage

  - In making the application even more informative, the API calls to Visual Crossing really provided a multitude of information and I think it would be great to include more information
    so the user can plan more accordingly with more information about the weather
  - Ability to look at weather at any part of the day, to make more informative decisions about when the user wants to host their event
  - The graphs can be isolated (currently can see Temp, humidity and wind speed information all at once) to hone in on a certain detail about the day that you want to look more specifically at

- Improvements to be made in the future

  - Crisp up the styling, I think the application definitely gets the job done with the information that is given to you, but more appealing styling can always be done
  - Implement a mobile application part of the assignment, there only is a web application at the moment but shifting this over to IOS development is definitely a possibility
  - Definietly can have users save mulitple locations to allow tracking of different places they may want to plan their events

- Self criticisms

  - I think I can do a better job with refactoring some of the code I wrote and I think I can reduce the code duplication, perhaps combining the code for these two charts into a helper function and passing the corresponding fields into the function
  - I said it before but styling, I think to flush out the project to its highest degree, styling is always a crucial part in attracting clients/users and making their experience as seamless as possible

  Overall, these are just my quick thoughts but I thoroughly enjoyed this process and look forwards to hearing what you guys have to think about it

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
